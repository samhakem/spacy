Hi P,

I decided it might be better and easier for you if I were to mount everything on Github and also for 
you to see that I can do this from the CLI. The link I sent you will simply redirect here now.

If you would like me to restore the link to the Pycharm 'code with me' plugin, do just let me know! I'll pop it over.

I'll be building this out further as I go, adding notes and explanations to help me understand and learn further.

Thanks, 
Sam
