# Processing Pipelines
#
# This chapter will show you everything you need to know about spaCy's processing pipeline.
# You'll learn what goes on under the hood when you process a text, how to write your own
# components and add them to the pipeline, and how to use custom attributes to add your
# own metadata to the documents, spans and tokens.

# This chapter is dedicated to processing pipelines: a series of functions applied to a doc
# to add attributes like part-of-speech tags, dependency labels or named entities.
#
# In this lesson, you'll learn about the pipeline components provided by spaCy, and what
# happens behind the scenes when you call nlp on a string of text.
