Notes:

What is nlp? Nlp as a blanket term strives to build programs that have
a level of language comprehension based on speech or unstructured text.
It then uses this comprehension to respond with text or speech of its own,
in much the same way as we do.

- unstructured text -  
add eggs and milk             
to shopping list
